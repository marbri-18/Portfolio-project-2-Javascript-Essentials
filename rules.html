      <h3>Game objectives</h3>
      <p>
        The objective is to score by rolling dice which simulates the game of cricket. The game is played with 2 unique six-sided dice; one is called a player die or batting die while the second one is called umpire die.
        Player die has 6 options marked '1', '2', '3', '4', 'owzthat', and '6'. Umpire die also has 6 options marked 'bowled', 'stumped', 'caught', 'not out', 'no ball', and 'LBW' respectively.  
      </p>
      <h3>Gameplay</h3>
      <p>        
        The game can be played between two players or alone. It has two formats to play for; Test Cricket or Limited Overs.                  
      </p>
      <p>
        Each player has a team of 11 members similar to a cricket game. 
        The batting side starts play by rolling batting die. 
      </p>
      <p>
        If player rolls a number other than 'owzthat', it is added to the batsman's score.
        The player keeps rolling batting die and adds score to the batsman's score until 'owzthat' turns up.
        Now umpire die is rolled and options of that die is used to determine fate of the batsman. if 'no ball' is rolled, then the batsman continues and an extra ball is given to the batsman (which means an additonal roll of batting die).
        If'not out' is rolled, then batsman remains not out. If other than 'no ball' or 'not out' is rolled then batsman is given out and next batsman starts.
      <br />
      <br />
        Player's turn ends depending upon format of the game. 
        In test cricket player's turn ends when 10 batsmen get out.
        In limited overs game player's turn ends when either the allocated overs are finished or 10 batsmen get out before allocated overs finish.
      <br />
        The player scoring most runs wins the game.
