      <h3>Game objectives</h3>
      <ol id="objectives">
        <li value="1">The objective is to beat the score generated by the computer.</li>
        <li>This must be done before losing 10 wickets.</li>
        <li>If the computer generated score is beaten before 10 wickets are lost, the player wins.</li>
        <li>If the player loses 10 wickets before reaching the computer generated score, the player loses.</li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Gameplay</h3>
      <ol id="gameplay">
        <li value="5">A player acts as a batsman attempting to score runs by hitting the "Next ball" button.</li>
        <li>There are seven possible outcomes of the "Next ball" button. These are "0 runs", "1", "2", "3", "4", "6" and "OWZthat".</li>
        <li>If player rolls a number other than 'owzthat', it is added to the batsman's score and total score.</li>
        <li>As in cricket there are two batsmen at the wicket at the same time. The batsman on-strike and the batsman at the non-strikers end.</li>
        <li>If the score is "1" or "3" the batsmen change ends as in cricket. The batsman who scored the runs becomes the non-striker
          and the previous non-striker becomes the on-strike batsman.</li>
        <li>If "OWZthat" is returned, then the player must hit the "Owzthat" button.</li>
        <li>The "OWZthat" button has 10 possible outcomes of "not out", "wide", "bye", "leg-bye", "no ball", "bowled", "caught", "stumped", "LBW" and "run out".</li>
        <li>If the outcome is "not out" the player continues and hits the "next ball" button.</li>
        <li>If the outcome is one of  "wide", "bye", "leg-bye" or "no ball" a single run is added to the "extras" and the total, the batsmen switch ends and play continues.</li>
        <li>If the outcome is one of "bowled", "caught", "stumped", "LBW" or "run out", the on-strike batsman's wicket is lost. The wickets score is incremented by "1". The next batsman comes in on a score of "0". Play continues with the new batsman on strike.</li>
        <li>Play continues until either 10 wickets are lost, In which case the computer wins, or...</li>
        <li>The computer's score is reached. In which case the players win.</li>
