# OWZthat
## Portfolio-project-2-Javascript-Essentials

### overview
Owzthat was a game I played when I was a child in the 1970's. It was based on the game of cricket and involved the rolling of two six sided dice. I thought it would be great if this game could be reproduced as an online version so users could experience the entertainment I had as a child with a few extra features. The user or player plays against the computer, which generates a target score based on one of four levels chosen by input from the player. The player has to beat the target set by the computer.

Owzthat demonstrates Javascript in its use of arrays, event listeners random number generators, conditional statements, manipulation of the DOM and functions to replicate the gameplay.
